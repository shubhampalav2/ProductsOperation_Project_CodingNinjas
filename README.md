# ProductsOperation_Project_CodingNinjas

Created application to perform different operations on Products.
- Considered Product class with properties as prodId, prodName, price, quantity, discount
- Created in-memory database of products using array
- Use cases that I have implemented in this project are
1. add product
2. display all product
3. delete product by prodId (if product doesnot exists throw ProductNotFoundException)
4. update product
5. search product based on prodId (if product doesnot exists throw ProductNotFoundException)
6. search product based on prodName (if product doesnot exists throw ProductNotFoundException)
7. display all product by ascending/descending order of price
8. display all product by ascending/descending order of discount
